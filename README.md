Emulate native integer and floating-point types in Python 2.x and 3.x.

Install the package via:

```bash
pip install nativetypes
````


## Comparison

There are several alternatives to *ntypes*, specifically: `ctypes`, `numpy`, `fixedint`, `cinc`, `cint`. However, *ntypes* also offers some features not present across all these packages.

|                  | *ntypes*     | [*ctypes*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) | [*numpy*](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy) | [*fixedint*](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fixedint) | [*cinc*](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cinc) | [*cint*](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cint) |
|------------------|:------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:----------:|:------:|:------:|
| Floating-point   | __Yes__      | Yes      | Yes     | -          | -      | -      |
| Implicit casts   | __Yes__      | -        | -       | Yes        | -      | Yes    |
| Custom aliases   | __Yes__      | -        | -       | -          | -      | -      |
| Slicing          | __Yes__      | -        | -       | Yes        | -      | -      |
| High-performance | -            | Yes      | -       | -          | Yes    | Yes    |

Other reasons might include that `numpy` is way too large dependency to be imported just for the sake of fixed-size integers. Note that high-performance is not a goal for this library.


## FAQ

> __What's the point of this library?__

This library is syntactic sugar for developers and reverse-engineers that want to port code from C/C++/ASM into Python and need all this low-level quirks: Overflows, underflows, casts, etc.

Although Python prevents many headaches with its arbitrarily large integers, writing code equivalent to functions written in C/C++/ASM means masking every operation, and doing dozens of conversions manually between distinct types. This library does that work for you.

> __Where can read about the API?__

The documentation is quite incomplete at this moment. Check the examples below or check the tests.

>  __Why is this package called *nativetypes*__?

I'm not good with naming. Ideally, I would have registered *ntypes* instead, but that one was apparently taken.


## Examples

* Fast inverse square root (see [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root#Overview_of_the_code))

```python
def rsqrt(number: float32):
    i = reinterpret_cast(int32, number)
    i = 0x5F3759DF - (i >> 1)
    y = reinterpret_cast(float32, i)
    y *= (1.5 - (0.5 * number * y * y))
    return y
```

* Ranbyus DGA (see [[2]](https://www.govcert.admin.ch/blog/25/when-mirai-meets-ranbyus)):
```python
def ranbyus_dga(timestamp):
    s = uint32(self.seed)
    t1 = uint32(t.day)
    t2 = uint32(t.month)
    t3 = uint32(t.year)
    
    name = ""
    for i in xrange(12):
        t1 = (t1 >> 15) ^ (16 * (t1 & 0x1FFF ^ 4 * (t1 ^ s)))
        t2 = ((t2 ^ (4 * t2)) >>  8) ^ ((t2 & 0xFFFFFFFE) * 14)
        t3 = ((t3 ^ (7 * t3)) >> 11) | ((t3 & 0xFFFFFFF0) << 17)
        s = (s >> 6) ^ (((t1 + 8 * s) << 8) & 0x3FFFF00)
        name += string.ascii_lowercase[int(t1 ^ t2 ^ t3) % 25]

    # TLD omitted
    return name
```
